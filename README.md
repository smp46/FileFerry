<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<div align="center">

[![FileFerry Screenshot][product-screenshot]](https://fileferry.xyz)

</div>

FileFerry is a browser-based application for direct file transfers without the
need to store the file on a third-party server. Users share files using a simple
passphrase â€“ the sender creates a unique phrase the receiver enters to connect.

The app utilizes js-libp2p for networking and WebRTC for transfers. Senders
register their p2p network address with a temporary passphrase through a lookup
API. Receivers use this passphrase to find and connect to senders, using a relay
server to establish the connection. Once that initial connection is made, both
parties establish a direct WebRTC connection.

When a direct connection is prevented by Network Address Translation (NAT) on
one or both ends, the app completes the transfer by using a relay server. This
server acts as a glue for the two connections, allowing two peers to
communicate, and uses only the bandwidth needed for the transfer. The entire
transfer is protected by end-to-end encryption using the Noise framework, with
x25519 key pairs for authentication and the ChaCha20Poly1305 cipher for data
encryption, ensuring your data stays private and secure.

### Built With

This project would not have been possible without the awesome contributors to
Libp2p. I hope one day I'll be able to contribute as well :)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

The recommended way to use FileFerry is via the
[Github Pages](https://fileferry.xyz) hosted version, it is deployed straight
from the `gh-pages` branch right here in the repo.

Otherwise, follow these steps to get FileFerry running locally. I run the
backend externally (on a seperate remote machine) to the front-end, your mileage
may vary as to how well this would or wouldn't work on a single host.

**This section requires updating regarding what needs to be changed to get this
running under a different domain (that isn't fileferry.xyz), stay tuned for
that.**

### Prerequisites

Here is what you need to build and run your own instance of FileFerry:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and
  [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and
  [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/smp46/FileFerry.git
   cd FileFerry
   ```

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies:** Navigate to the root of the cloned
   repository and install the Node.js packages for the frontend:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build Backend Docker Images:** The `passphrase-server` (Go) and
   `relay-server` (Node.js) are built as Docker images. You need to build them
   from their respective directories.

   ```
   docker build -t passphrase-server ./backend/passphrase-server
   ```

   ```
   docker build -t relay-server ./backend/relay-server
   ```

4. **Configure Docker-Compose**

   - **Relay Server:** The `relay-server` currently uses a `.env` file for basic
     config, find this in `./backend/relay-server. The only addition you _need_
     is a Base64 encoded private key for a persistent peer id.
   - **CoTURN Configuration:** The `coturn` service requires a
     `my-turnserver.conf` file. `coturn` uses a config file found at
     `./backend/relay-server/my-turnserver.conf`, you can customise this as you
     want/need to to suit your network environment.

5. **Start Backend Services with Docker Compose:** Navigate to the `backend`
   directory and start all services defined in `docker-compose.yaml`. This will
   launch the `coturn` server, `passphrase-server`, and `relay-server`.

   ```
   cd backend
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This command will run the services in detached mode, meaning they will run in
   the background.

6. **Run the Frontend Application:** Once the backend services are running,
   return to the root of your repo directory and start the frontend application.

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will typically start a development server and open FileFerry in your
   browser. Look for output in the terminal indicating the local URL (e.g.,
   `http://localhost:5173`).

7. **Optional: Build for Production:** To build the static website files for
   deployment, run:

   ```
   npm run build
   ```

   The compiled website files will be located in the `dist` directory, ready for
   static hosting.

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

- [x] File transfer resumption after broken or interrupted streams.
- [x] Favicons using the FileFerry logo.
- [x] Typescript conversion with TypeDoc documentation.
- [x] Acquire and hold wake lock while transferring.
- [ ] Make it easier to configure your own FileFerry instance, i.e. centralise
      all variables that need to be changed.
- [x] Night mode, with a moon and stars in the sky.
- [x] Direct links to transfers to facilitate easier sharing.
- [x] Share links to transfers.
- [x] QR Code links to transfers.
- [x] Prevent _trigger_ words being generated for passphrase.
- [x] Validate file integrity after transfer.

If you have any ideas or feedback, I would appreciate if you
